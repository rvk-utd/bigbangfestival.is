Social Share adds configurable social network share links to nodes

Links can be added for these social networks:
 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Google Buzz
 - Myspace
 - MSN Live
 - Yahoo
 - Linked In
 - Orkut
 - Digg

Links are added to all nodes of the types configured to allow it, and appear
with a class name based on the social network being shared to.

Example:

<a class="social-share-facebook" href="...">Facebook</a>
<a class="social-share-twitter" href="...">Twitter</a>

This facilitates styling the links as icons, or whatever best suits the site.


ICONS
=======
Beginning with the 2.x branch, an icon pack based on the GPL licensed social
media icon set released by elegantthemes.com are included. These icons can be
optionally enabled via the admin config in 16px or 32px sizes.
